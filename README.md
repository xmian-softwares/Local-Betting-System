# LOCAL BETTING SYSTEM

##  Project Overview
**EXPECT BETTING** is a PHP & MySQL–based web betting system developed **solo** as a backend-focused project.  
The system allows users to place **single and multiple bets**, while administrators manage results, permissions, and system income through a dedicated admin panel.

This project demonstrates real-world concepts such as authentication, role-based access control, database-driven workflows, and admin management.
